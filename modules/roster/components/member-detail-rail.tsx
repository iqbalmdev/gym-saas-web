/**
 * One member, with everything the roster table used to hide.
 *
 * The table showed four columns — name, payment, check-in, actions — and the
 * member's phone, join date and actual subscription lines were nowhere. The
 * rail carries them, plus the two actions, so an Admin fielding "what am I
 * paying for?" at the counter can answer it without leaving the page.
 *
 * Scope: gym-owned data only. Progress, nutrition and wearables are
 * CLIENT-owned and need a DataGrant (`000-project-context.mdc`), so there is
 * nothing of that kind here to leak.
 *
 * Both mutations are passed down rather than owned here: offboarding unmounts
 * this component, which would take the mutation and its error with it.

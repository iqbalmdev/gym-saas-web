# UI design system — rules

Prescriptive. If a screen disagrees with this doc, the screen is wrong.
Direction and light/dark mechanics live in `ui-theme.md`; token definitions live in
`lib/theme/crm-tokens.css`. This doc says **which token for which job**.

## 1. Tokens

Two layers, one source. `lib/theme/crm-tokens.css` defines the CRM tokens; the alias
block in `app/globals.css` points shadcn's names at them (ADR-0006). **Retheme by editing
`crm-tokens.css` only** — never a literal colour in a feature, never a new `--color-*`
in `globals.css`.

| Job | Token | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Page background | `--color-canvas` | the shell, never a panel |
| Recessed area | `--color-canvas-accent` | nav rail, inset regions |
| Panel / card / row | `--color-surface` | everything readable sits here |
| Hairlines, dividers | `--color-border` | `/80` or `/70` for softer table rules |
| Body text | `--color-fg` | |
| Secondary text | `--color-fg-muted` | labels, metadata, timestamps |
| Primary action, active nav | `--color-accent` + `--color-accent-fg` | near-black by design, not indigo |
| Status | `--color-info` `--color-warning` `--color-danger` `--color-success` | §3 governs when |
| Panel radius | `--radius-panel` | panels and tables |
| Control radius | `--radius-control` | inputs, buttons |
| Pill radius | `--radius-pill` | badges only |

Use Tailwind 4 shorthand — `text-(--color-fg)`, not `text-[var(--color-fg)]`.

## 2. Density

Admin is an operations tool: tables and inboxes, not marketing.

- **Table cells** `px-4 py-3`. **Header row** `text-xs uppercase tracking-wide` in
  `--color-fg-muted`. Reference: `modules/roster/components/roster-panel.tsx`.
- **Panels** `p-5`, or `p-4 md:p-6` where a panel holds a form.
- **Panel stack** `space-y-6`; **section stack inside a panel** `space-y-3`.
- Prefer a table or a plain list over cards-for-everything.

## 3. Status badges — one semantic scale

### The rule that overrides visual instinct

**`unpaid` is `warning`, never `danger`.** Entitlement follows subscription dates, not
`payment_status` (`000-project-context.mdc`) — an unpaid member still trains. Rendering
unpaid in red tells the Admin the member is blocked, which is false. **`danger` is
reserved for states that actually deny access**, and today exactly one does:
`checkInBlocked`.

### The scale

Four tones. Every domain status maps onto one of them, so a colour means the same thing
on every screen.

| Tone | Means | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `neutral` | inert, expected, no action | outline badge |
| `positive` | terminal good | `--color-success` |
| `warning` | needs attention, still functioning | `--color-warning` |
| `danger` | access denied / destructive | `--color-danger` |

### Mapping

| Domain | State | Tone |
|---|---|---|
| Payment (`paid`/`partial`/`unpaid`) | `paid` | positive |
| | `partial` | warning |
| | `unpaid` | warning — *not* danger, see above |
| Membership (`ACTIVE`/`INACTIVE`) | `ACTIVE` | positive |
| | `INACTIVE` | neutral |
| Invite — membership **and** staff | `PENDING` | neutral |
| | `ACCEPTED` | positive |
| | `EXPIRED` | warning |
| | `REVOKED` | neutral — a deliberate Admin action, not a failure |
| Check-in | `Blocked` | **danger** (the only one) |
| | `Allowed` | neutral |

Membership invites and staff invites share one enum shape and therefore one mapping.
Don't diverge them.

### Lead pipeline is not a status

`NEW → CONTACTED → TRIAL → CONVERTED → LOST` is **progress**, not health. Forcing it onto
the health scale would imply `TRIAL` is a warning, which is nonsense. Pipeline stages
render **neutral**, with two exceptions: `CONVERTED` = positive, `LOST` = neutral at
reduced emphasis (`--color-fg-muted`). Never colour the middle stages.

### Implementation

The scale is wired up via `lib/ui/status-tone.ts` — `StatusTone` (`neutral` | `positive` |
`warning` | `danger`) plus `statusToneBadgeVariant()`, which maps a tone to the `<Badge
variant>` that renders it (`outline` / `success` / `warning` / `destructive`). Each
domain's tone mapping lives next to its labels: `membershipPaymentStatusTone` and
`membershipInviteStatusTone` in `membership-invites-labels.ts`, `staffInviteStatusTone` in
`staff-invites-labels.ts` (aliased to the same `inviteStatusTone()` so membership and
staff invites can't diverge). Every domain status is now a `<Badge>` — never bare text —
across `roster-panel`, `members-admin-panel`, `membership-invite-inbox`, and
`staff-invites-admin-panel`.

`components/ui/badge.tsx` now ships `success` and `warning` variants alongside shadcn's
four, styled from `--color-success` / `--color-warning` the same way `destructive` is
styled from `--color-danger`.

Lead pipeline stages render through `leadStatusTone()` in `leads-labels.ts` — neutral for
every stage except `CONVERTED`, plus `isLeadStageMuted()` for the reduced-emphasis `LOST`
treatment. The CRM queue shows the stage as a `<Badge>`; the rail's `<Select>` is where it
is changed.

## 4. Empty states

Use `components/ui/empty-state.tsx` (title + description) or a single muted `<p>` inside
the panel. Rules:

- Say what **would** be here and how it gets here: *"No leads yet. Capture a walk-in with
  the form above."*
- Never an error tone for an expected-empty list.
- Never placeholder/fake rows.

### Missing DataGrant — neutral, non-judgemental

A missing grant is **not an error and not a gap to be closed**. Personal health data is
CLIENT-owned; the member choosing not to share is the system working correctly.

- **Do:** *"Progress not shared."*
- **Don't:** *"Member has not granted access"* (implies withholding),
  *"No data available"* (implies a fault), or any *"Ask member to share"* prompt — that
  turns a privacy decision into pressure from someone with authority over them.
- Same neutral register as any other empty state. No warning colour, no icon.

## 5. Component rules

- shadcn primitives live in `components/ui/` and carry **no business logic**.
- Base UI `Select` shows the raw value unless given a children render-prop —
  always map through the module's `*-labels.ts`.
- Admin chrome in `components/admin/`; module UI in `modules/<m>/components/`.
- Loading: route-level `loading.tsx` + panel skeletons (ADR-0009). Skeletons mirror the
  real layout so nothing shifts; header placeholders are grey bars, never duplicated copy.

## 6. Desk layout — queue + rail

The shape for any screen whose job is *work through a list of people*. First consumer:
the renewals desk. `components/admin/work-queue-layout.tsx` owns it and holds **no domain
logic**, so a second module adopts it by passing different children, never by copying it.

| Piece | Job |
|---|---|
| `WorkQueueLayout` | The grid: summary, toolbar, queue, sticky rail |
| `WorkQueue` / `WorkQueueRow` | The skimmable list; row = urgency dot + title + meta + actions |
| `WorkQueueRailPanel` / `WorkQueueRailSection` | The detail rail's surface and its blocks |
| `MetricStrip` | The money/volume summary above the queue |
| `SegmentedFilter` | Client-side narrowing (see §7) |
| `WorkQueueSkeleton` | The one Suspense fallback for all of them |
| `ContactActions` | `tel:` / WhatsApp / `mailto:` for whoever the rail is about |
| `ErrorNotice` | Panel-level failure banner |
| `ConfirmActionDialog` | The confirm step for anything destructive (§10) |

Rules:

- **Two columns at `lg`, stacked below it.** The rail scrolls into view on selection when
  stacked, but a row must still be actionable on its own — the rail is context, never the
  only place an action lives.
- **The row is the record; the rail is the context.** Do not move a row's primary action
  into the rail.
- **Glass on the summary strip only.** `MetricStrip` may be translucent because it
  summarises; the queue and rail stay solid. This is the concrete reading of
  `ui-theme.mdc`'s "no loud glass" — decoration must not cost legibility on dense rows.
- **The urgency dot uses `StatusTone`**, via `statusToneDotClass()` — never a bespoke
  colour, so a tone means the same thing on a dot as on a badge (§3).
- **`onSelect` is optional.** A row with nothing to open must not render a focusable
  full-row overlay — keyboard users would tab into it and get silence. Omitting it also
  drops the hover cue, so an inert row does not promise a click.

### Which screens get it

**Every Admin ops screen now does**: renewals, CRM, the attendance desk, the members desk
(roster + invites) and the plan catalog. Settings is not an ops screen and keeps its
forms.

An earlier version of this section said the opposite — that plans and the roster were
"correct as tables" and a rail would have nothing to put in it. That was wrong twice, and
the reason is worth keeping:

- A **member** has contact details, a join date and real subscription lines. The
  four-column table hid all of it, so the page could not answer "what is this member
  paying for?".
- A **plan** has three editable fields — name, term, price — that `updatePlan` supported
  from the start and no screen ever exposed. The rail did not restyle the catalog; it
  unlocked writes that were unreachable.

So the test is **not** "is the queue made of people". It is: *does an item have more to it
than the row shows, or actions the row cannot hold?* If yes, it earns a rail. An **invite**
genuinely does not have much — a name, a plan, a deadline — and its rail says so plainly
rather than padding itself out. That is the honest version of "a rail with nothing in it
is worse than no rail".

Where there is no per-row detail at all, the row itself can be the action — the attendance
desk marks a member in on row click rather than opening anything.

### Two queues on one desk

The members desk shows members *or* invites behind a `SegmentedFilter`. They stay separate
query keys, because they are mutated independently and a check-in block must not refetch
invites; they share a queue because an Admin looking for a person should not have to know
which list that person is currently in. Reach for this only when the two populations
answer the same question — not to save a route.

## 7. Filters — which ones navigate

Two kinds, and the difference is not cosmetic:

| Filter changes… | Mechanism | Why |
|---|---|---|
| What the **server fetches** (a date window) | `FilterTabs` — real `<Link>` | It is a query parameter; it must re-run the fetch and belongs in the query key |
| Only **which rows show** (status, search) | `SegmentedFilter` + `useShallowSearchParam` | Already in the query cache; a `<Link>` would re-run the page and its `prefetchQuery` per keystroke |

Both end up in the URL, satisfying `state-management.mdc` §2 — the second uses
`window.history.replaceState`, the documented Next.js shallow-routing escape hatch, so the
link stays shareable without a round-trip. Filter controls live **above** the `<Suspense>`
boundary so they stay clickable while new data streams in (ADR-0009).

## 8. Numbers and money

- Money renders through `formatMoney()` (`lib/ui/format-money.ts`) — `en-IN`, whole
  rupees. The API returns price **snapshots**; format them, never recompute them
  (`000-project-context.mdc`).
- Columns of figures get `tabular-nums`, **not** `font-mono`. Alignment was always the
  goal, and Geist Mono gives a comma its own character cell — `₹6,497` renders as
  `₹6 , 497`. Tabular figures align the digits and leave the separator alone.
- Never apply tabular figures to prose. "Ends in 5 days" is a sentence, not a column.

## 9. Errors

- **Panel-level** failure — an action or a list did not work: `ErrorNotice`. One banner,
  one radius, and it renders nothing for a null message so callers need no guard.
- **Field-level** failure — this input is invalid: an inline `<p role="alert">` beside the
  control. Do not promote it to the panel banner; that separates the message from the
  thing that caused it.
- Copy stays calm and says what to do next (`error-handling.mdc`). An expected-empty list
  is never an error (§4).

## 10. Destructive actions

Anything that cannot be undone from the UI goes through `ConfirmActionDialog`:
offboarding a member, deleting a plan or a lead, revoking an invite, blocking a check-in.
These write to the API immediately — there is nothing held back to reverse — and several
sit inches from a button the Admin presses all day (Delete beside Deactivate in the plan
catalog; Offboard beside Block check-in on the roster).

**The copy is the feature.** `description` is required and must say what happens to the
gym's data, in the Admin's terms:

- **Do:** *"They stop appearing on the roster and can no longer be marked in at the desk.
  Their attendance and billing history is kept."*
- **Don't:** *"This action cannot be undone."* A generic warning teaches people to click
  through it, which is worse than no dialog because it costs a click and buys nothing.

`confirmLabel` repeats the verb — "Offboard", "Delete plan", never "OK". Cancel is listed
first so the safe path is the one a hurried Enter takes.

`destructive={false}` for reversible-but-serious actions. Blocking a check-in denies
access today but is undone with one click tomorrow, so it asks without the red button.
**Unblocking asks nothing** — restoring access needs no ceremony.

### Testing them

While this dialog is open, Base UI marks the rest of the page `aria-hidden`, so **every
`getByRole` query against the page behind it returns nothing**. A spec that clicks Delete
and then asserts `toHaveCount(0)` on the row passes whether or not the delete ever ran —
it is measuring the open dialog. Go through `ConfirmDialog` (`e2e/pages/confirm-dialog.page.ts`),
whose `confirm()` waits for the dialog to close before returning. Assert the cancel path
too: an untested Cancel is an untested feature.

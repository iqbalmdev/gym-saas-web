# Progress

Living project stage for agents and humans. Log entries live one-per-file in `docs/progress/`.

## Current stage

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Agent OS (rules, skills, docs) | Done — drift from `e537810` repaired; Cursor + Claude Code parity |
| Tooling + CI | Done — Prettier/ESLint architecture rules/Husky/lint-staged + GitHub Actions (ADR-0006); `typecheck` runs `next typegen` first so `LayoutProps` exists on a clean CI checkout |
| Folder architecture | Done — top-level `modules/<module>/`; `lib/` is shared infrastructure (ADR-0007, ADR-0008). E2E fixtures split into `lib/api/e2e/store.ts` (shared state) + nine per-module fakes, closing ADR-0007's last deferred consequence — no shared-file hotspots remain |
| UI foundation | Done — shadcn/ui on `data-theme`, tokens aliased to the CRM palette (ADR-0006) |
| Admin desk layout (queue + rail) | Done — `components/admin/` chrome (`work-queue-layout`, `metric-strip`, `segmented-filter`, `work-queue-skeleton`, `contact-actions`, `error-notice`, `confirm-action-dialog`), domain-free, landing the `stash@{3}` hybrid prototype as real code. Adopted by **every Admin ops screen**: renewals, CRM, attendance, members (roster + invites) and the plan catalog. Settings keeps its forms. Fully token-indirected, so dark mode needed no per-component work. Colour palette still deferred by design |
| Architecture plan + SOLID/DI | Done (ADR-0003, ADR-0004) |
| Matt Pocock skills | Done (`.agents/skills`) |
| Postman API collection | Sibling at **`9b0b561`** (Convert Lead — now wired, see M11 below — + trainer list + Nutrition/Coaching/Health Sync, still unwired). Cloud inject still blocked — Postman MCP 401; Desktop Import the sibling JSON |
| Client/Admin auth guide | Done — `docs/api/client-auth.md` |
| Silent session refresh | Done — `proxy.ts` rotates the access/refresh pair via `POST /auth/refresh` before it expires; cookie `Max-Age` decoupled from the access-token TTL (`2026-08-16` fix, see progress log) so it survives to be refreshed instead of the browser dropping it at the 1h mark. Verified live against prod (`2026-08-16`): rotation + 401-on-stale-token both confirmed; Google-lane compatibility inferred high-confidence (shared Supabase issuer), not directly browser-tested |
| Auth research notes | Archived — `docs/archive/research/` |
| MCP (Context7, Postman, GitHub, Supabase, Vercel, Playwright) | Configured + connected in Cursor |
| Playwright E2E skill | Done — `.cursor/skills/playwright-e2e-testing` (from fugazi/test-automation-skills-agents) |
| Next.js app scaffold | Done — App Router + Clean Arch ports/adapters (build green) |
| Feature modules | M1 auth; M2 Settings-first + invites; **M3 membership invites + my-data-grants**; **M4 plans/addons**; **roster / attendance / renewals** incl. **trainer assignment**; **profile & progress**; **M11 leads**. Destructive actions across every module are behind one confirm step |
| Admin CRM-light chrome | Done — Base UI `Sidebar` primitive (icon rail + `Sheet` mobile drawer + cookie-persisted state), light/dark tokens, Settings-only first-run; Client persona shares the same header atoms |
| Admin navigation latency | Done — page shells do no network work; `loading.tsx` per ops route; filter tabs are `<Link>` in the shell (was a raw `<a>` full-page reload) (ADR-0009) |
| Client data layer | Done — **TanStack Query v5** across all six Admin modules (ADR-0011): RSC `prefetchQuery` + `<HydrationBoundary>` for first paint, `/api/*` route handlers for refetch, mutations wrapping the existing Server Actions so the auth→lane→tenant gate never moved. Retired all `*-data.tsx`, every `useOptimistic` block, and 18 of 22 `router.refresh()` sites. Navigation between ops screens now serves from cache instead of re-paying ~400ms per hop. CLIENT persona migrated too; the 4 remaining `router.refresh()` calls are session creation and Admin-shell-mode changes, which cache invalidation cannot re-render |

**Summary:** Roster, attendance desk, renewals inbox, and client my-data-grants wired against Postman tip `9b0b561` (sibling pulled 2026-08-19; cloud collection still waiting on Postman MCP re-auth). Plans + Leads + membership invites remain live. Agent OS repaired after the `e537810` rule drift; tooling + CI landed (ADR-0006). Domain slices live at top-level `modules/` (ADR-0008 amending ADR-0007). Admin shell rebuilt on Base UI's `Sidebar` primitive, replacing the hand-rolled collapsible nav. Admin navigation reworked to stream the page shell and stop reloading the document on filter clicks (ADR-0009). Renewals, CRM and the attendance desk share a reusable queue + rail layout: renewals joins member names and contact actions from the roster, CRM reads as a call list ordered by who is owed a follow-up, and the attendance desk is search-to-act and shows who is already in. Client `/client/profile` and an Admin/Trainer grant-aware member detail landed alongside a trainer-assigned roster view and the split-screen sign-in redesign; the app now displays as **Yeah Buddy**.

## Next up

**Team setup:**

1. ~~Apply the status-badge scale~~ — **Done.** `lib/ui/status-tone.ts` (`StatusTone` + `statusToneBadgeVariant()`), `badge.tsx` got `success`/`warning` variants, and every domain status (`roster-panel`, `members-admin-panel`, `membership-invite-inbox`, `staff-invites-admin-panel`) is now a `<Badge>` with the correct tone — no more bare-text statuses, no more `roster-panel` payment badges all rendering `outline`.
2. **Adopt shadcn components per surface** — Done: `table`/`select`/`badge`/`checkbox`/`radio-group`/`textarea` landed across every Admin panel and the auth flows (roster, attendance, leads, members, plans, staff-invites, login, Google callback, create-gym, data-grants, membership-invite inbox); `dialog` now has two consumers (the renewals part-payment prompt and CRM lead capture); `dropdown-menu` is still installed without a screen using it.
3. **Module ownership split** with Iqbal, then feature branches + PRs — now unblocked on the tooling side: the last shared hotspot (`e2e-fixtures.ts`) is split per module.
4. ~~Embed `gymOrgId` / `gymName` in the session~~ — **no longer needed for latency**: the gym lookup is cached client-side by TanStack, so navigation no longer re-pays it. Still an option if the *first* load's sequential hop matters (would need HMAC signing first — ADR-0010 work is stashed, not landed).

**Product:**

6. ~~Assign trainer / trainer list~~ — **Done.** `List Gym Trainers` + `Assign Trainer`
   wired end to end: `listTrainers` on the gym-orgs port (paginated envelope, `GymTrainersPage`),
   `assignTrainer` on the roster writer, and a coach picker in the members rail. `assignedTrainerId`
   had been parsed into `RosterMember` since the module landed and rendered nowhere. The API's
   `COACHING_ADDON_REQUIRED` (422) is stated up front in the control and surfaced as plain
   copy, not re-derived client-side. No unassign — the contract has no such request. See
   `docs/progress/2026-08-19-assign-trainer-roster.md`.
7. ~~Profile & Progress~~ — **Done.** Client `/client/profile` + Admin/Trainer grant-aware member detail; Trainer assigned roster via `GET /my-assigned-members`. Profile menu owns dark mode for Admin/Trainer/Client. See `docs/progress/2026-08-26-trainer-profile-menu.md`.
7b. ~~Client sidebar~~ — **Done.** Member shell mirrors Admin sidebar: Home, Profile, Nutrition, Diet, Workouts, Health Sync (placeholders until those Postman modules are wired). See `docs/progress/2026-08-27-client-sidebar.md`.
7c. ~~Client pattern alignment~~ — **Done.** `ClientStubPage` = `AdminStubPage`; shell/user/initials match Admin; debug adapter log removed. See `docs/progress/2026-08-27-client-pattern-alignment.md`.
7d. ~~Sign-in screen redesign~~ — **Done.** Split-screen auth: tinted hero panel (brand + what the product does) beside a surface form column; larger controls, letter-spaced OTP field, Google brand mark. Tokens only; login POM names unchanged so all 15 login E2E specs pass. See `docs/progress/2026-08-27-auth-screen-redesign.md`.
7e. ~~Rename to **Yeah Buddy**~~ — **Done.** UI display name + `YB` tile across Admin/Client/auth chrome and page metadata; repo/package identity stays `gym-saas-web`. The full E2E run it prompted (first since `6ec42c4`) caught two regressions from that commit, both fixed: Sign out returned a server error (cookie mutation in a Server Component — now the existing `signOutAction`), and `/admin/members` gated on `roleCode === 'ADMIN'`, hiding the roster from every other staff role (now gated on `TRAINER`). See `docs/progress/2026-08-27-yeah-buddy-rename.md`.
8. Deploy gym-backend with `GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_ORIGINS` + Supabase redirect URL for web Google callback.
9. ~~Optional: deeper renewals UX (filters, member name join)~~ — **Done.** Rebuilt as a
   queue + rail desk: roster join for names/phone/email (no new endpoint — the roster
   rides along in the screen payload like the attendance desk), window/payment/search
   filters, a money summary strip, `tel:`/WhatsApp/`mailto:` contact actions, and a real
   amount input replacing the `price / 2` guess for partial payments. See
   `docs/progress/2026-08-20-renewals-desk-work-queue-layout.md`.
10. ~~Audit the other modules against the desk layout~~ — **Done.** Only two modules wanted
    it *at the time*: CRM and the attendance desk. That call was later reversed for roster
    and plans — see `2026-08-20-desk-layout-everywhere.md` and §6 — and the layout now
    covers every ops screen. Plus a consistency pass: one `ErrorNotice`, one money formatter (`formatPlanPrice` was a
    byte-identical duplicate), and radii folded back onto the three-value scale. See
    `docs/progress/2026-08-20-desk-layout-module-audit.md`.
11. ~~Guard the destructive actions~~ — **Done.** One `ConfirmActionDialog` across all six
    (offboard, delete plan, delete lead, revoke membership invite, revoke staff invite,
    block check-in); unblocking asks nothing. Copy says what happens to the gym's data
    rather than "cannot be undone". Also fixed a false-passing spec: Base UI hides the
    page behind an open dialog from the a11y tree, so `toHaveCount(0)` on a row was
    measuring the dialog, not the delete.
12. ~~Watch for E2E flakiness on a loaded machine~~ — **Done, and it was not the machine.**
    Two real isolation bugs, both of which *report as timeouts* because a strict-mode
    violation re-resolves the locator until the budget expires. (a) `captureTrigger` was a
    non-`exact` `'Capture lead'`, which substring-matches the row overlay `Open E2E Capture
    Lead` while the CRM spec's own lead exists — two elements, failed click. (b) Every
    fixture minted ids from array length (`plan-e2e-${e2ePlans.length + 1}`); since workers
    share one store, a create following another worker's delete reissued a **live** id, so
    `findIndex` deleted the wrong row. Fixed with `exact` locators and `e2eNextId()`.
    12 consecutive green runs at six workers. `playwright.config.ts` is unchanged — raising
    the timeout would have fixed nothing and a lower worker count would have hidden it. See
    `docs/progress/2026-08-21-e2e-flakiness-root-cause.md`.
13. ~~The plan catalog read as "a small weird" layout~~ — **Done.** It was the one ops
    screen the queue+rail template did not fit: a catalog has no urgency and no day to
    summarise, so the metric strip restated its own two rows and the wide column held the
    sparse content while the 21rem rail held the form. Metric strip → one muted line, rail
    → `railWidth="wide"`, queue rows → real aligned term/price columns (`WorkQueueRow`
    gained a `columns` slot), delete → quiet and fenced by a hairline. Shared chrome takes
    both new options with today's behaviour as the default, so the other four desks are
    untouched. See `docs/progress/2026-08-21-plans-catalog-proportions.md`.
14. ~~Convert Lead~~ — **Done.** `POST …/leads/:leadId/convert` wired: creates a PENDING
    membership invite from a lead in one call and flips it to `CONVERTED`. The rail's stage
    picker no longer offers `CONVERTED` directly — it is reachable only through Convert now,
    so a converted lead always has a real invite behind it, not just a status label. Picked
    up a real gap on the way: the web `Lead` type had no `email` field despite the API
    carrying one since before this module landed, which Convert's fallback rule depends on.
    Shared the members desk's plan/payment picker (`InvitePlanFields`) rather than
    duplicating it — its first E2E coverage landed with this, since nothing had exercised
    that form before. See `docs/progress/2026-09-12-convert-lead.md`.
15. Optional: confirm Google-lane `/auth/refresh` compatibility with an actual browser OAuth round-trip (curl-verified for OTP-lane on `2026-08-16`; Google-lane inferred, not directly hit).
